Batch operation for changing tag categories
  *i.e. change all tags to generic where index_count < 50

Export all images with given tag/tag list
  *Ideally in a manner that lets you use the batch upload script to re-upload
   them without losing any tags and making as few directories as possible.
  *Maybe preserve other data like aliases, comments, etc.

"sample" image generation for large images

Search images by other properties
  *title
  *comment count

Default tags for new uploads
  *per user
  *per IP?

Test batch tag operations

Test batch remove script


BUGFIXES:
  - admin/alias.php
    *Cannot approve aliases that contain a single quote (')
  - classes/image.class.php
    *Cannot create thumbnails for .bmp images
    *Currently php crashes on line 189 (inside getremoteimage()) when dealing 
    with fuckhuge images, need to do sanity check on image size before entering
    the while loop, or check how much memory is currently allocated every with
    each iteration and see if we're approaching the limit
