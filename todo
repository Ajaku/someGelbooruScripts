Proper tag category implementation
  *Addition and Deletion of tag categories

Export all images with given tag/tag list
  *Ideally in a manner that lets you use the batch upload script without losing
   any tag data and making as few directories as possible.
  *Would it even be possible to export other data like aliases, comments, etc?

"sample" generation for really large images

Edit and remove Aliases

Search images by other properties
  *title
  *comment count

Default tags for new uploads
  *per user
  *per IP?

Test batch tag operations

Test batch remove script
