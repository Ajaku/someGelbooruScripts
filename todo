Proper tag category implementation
  *Addition and Deletion of tag categories

Export all images with given tag/tag list
  *Ideally in a manner that lets you use the batch upload script to re-upload
   them without losing any tags and making as few directories as possible.
  *Maybe preserve other data like aliases, comments, etc.

"sample" image generation for large images

Search images by other properties
  *title
  *comment count

Default tags for new uploads
  *per user
  *per IP?

Test batch tag operations

Test batch remove script


BUGFIXES:
  - admin/alias.php
    *Cannot approve aliases that contain a single quote (')
