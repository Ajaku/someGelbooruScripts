====================
* Recursive Import *
====================
files:
 - recursive_batch_add.php

Slight modification of batch_add.php making it fully recursive (except for
maybe symbolic links, haven't tested w/ those). Also added some coloring to the
success and failure messages so you can tell at a glance which ones failed.
there's also a count of how many files were processed, how many succeeded, and
how many failed.


================
* Special Tags *
================
files:
 - config.php
 - default.css
 - post_view.php

Sort of a band-aid solution until v0.2.X or maybe even 0.3 is released as I'm
sure those versions have a much better implementation than just putting a
specially recognized string at the beginning of a tag. One thing that isn't on
the site right now though (v0.2.5 at TOW) is keeping special tags separate from
regular ones when viewing a specific post like danbooru does; that capability
has been added to post_view.php. Special tags are those that begin with a
string that is present in the $special_tags array (character_doofus, game_pong,
etc.)
